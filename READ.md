# Business Request 

In this project, a company has identified a gap in understanding its customer demographics-specifically, the gender distrubution within the customer base and how it might influence product purchases. 

Significant amount of customer data is stored in an on premise SQL database, key shareholders have requested a comprehensive dashboard. 

This dashboard should provide insights into  sales by gender and product category, showing total products sold, total sales revenue and a clear gender split among customers. Additionally, they need the ability to filter this data by products category and gender, with a user friendly interface for date-based queries.

# Solution 

- Build a pipeline to extract the data from the SQL on-premise data
- Loads the data into Azure
- Peforms the necessary transformations that make the data more query friendly 
- Pipeline should be scheduled to run automatically every day.
